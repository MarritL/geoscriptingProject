# Function to plot the altitude of the simulations and the animal tracks
#
# Input: 
#   simulations: list with matrices with extracted raster values per point location as output from combineSimTrack
#   animalNames: vector with animalNames
# Output:
#   plot of simulated trajectories in grey and real trajectory in red per animal

  for (animal in 1:length(animalNames)){
    
    matrix <- simulations[[animal]]
    
    # create sequence for x axis
    timeseq <- seq(from = 1, by = 1, length.out = nrow(matrix))
    
    # create plot
    #png()
